                            I'm a creative person! <br>
                            Not only in the design perspective but also when it comes to DIY builds.<br>
                            I've made a giant power-bank to charge my drone batterys, I took my old go-cart and putt a
                            motor on
                            it, I fixed some old motorbikes, and the thing I'm the most proud of is my own
                            flame-thrower!<br>

                        <p class="content__part--text">
                            I started making designs when I got into YouTube. I looked up tutorials and tried some
                            stuff.
                            After
                            a while I got beter and beter, so I started Designah. It was my "company" where I made some
                            designs
                            for friends, DJ's, start-up companys,... <br>
                            When that started to take off I boutgh myself a new camera and started with photografy and
                            video-montages. Check them out on the <a href="/pages/work.html">work page</a>!
                            When I graduated my high-school, I wanted to do somthing with design. But all the things I
                            knew
                            where to specific till one day my parents came with Devine! <br>
                            I fell in love with the fact that I would be able to make sites on my own! So now I'm in my
                            1st
                            year...

                            account that my brother and
                            me
                            started and we took funny photo's with our small kids glasses. I bought the glasses from <a

                                rob</a>, he makes some funny photoschops too. Then I made some photoshops and video
                            edits.
                            <br>

                            I'm a scout leader here in the lokal scout in Belgium. I've been in it my whole life! We
                            learned to make fire and we could play in the nature, what do u want more as a kid?
                            I also made some of my best friends there! The ambiance back there is so much fun that I
                            want
                            to live there... <br>
                            In the last year before my leadership my year and me left for a road trip through Europe,
                            one
                            of the best experiences I ever had!
